1604
A double blessing is a double grace;
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
A gentleman, courtier.
A noise within: 'let her come in. '
A norwegian captain.
A priest.
A room in the castle.
A second time i kill my husband dead
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A table and flagons of wine on it.
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends. "

Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. Exit.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
All may be well. He kneels.
All. Gentlemen!
All. Lights, lights, lights!
All. No, let's come in!
All. Our duty to your honour.
All. Treason! Treason!
All. We will, we will!
Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And for my means, i'll husband them so well
And for that purpose i'll anoint my sword.
And i beseech you instantly to visit
And i, of ladies most deject and wretched,
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
And never come mischance between us twain!
And now, laertes, what's the news with you?
And of all christian souls, i pray god. God b' wi', you.
And shall i couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And these few precepts in thy memory
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
And what make you from wittenberg, horatio?
And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
And will he not come again?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Anon, as patient as the female dove
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Away! For everything is seal'd and done
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
Be as ourself in denmark. Madam, come.
Be buried quick with her, and so will i.
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
Be you and i behind an arras then.
Behind the arras i'll convey myself
Ber. 'tis here!
Ber. 'tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, francisco.
Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
Ber. He.
Ber. How now, horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Ber. I have seen nothing.
Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
Ber. In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
Ber. It would be spoke to.
Ber. Last night of all,
Ber. Long live the king!
Ber. Looks it not like the king? Mark it, horatio.
Ber. Say-
Ber. See, it stalks away!
Ber. Sit down awhile,
Ber. Welcome, horatio. Welcome, good marcellus.
Ber. Well, good night.
Ber. Who's there. ?
Bernardo, officer.
Both [mar. And ber. ] we do, my lord.
Both. Arm'd, my lord.
Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Both. Longer, longer.
Both. My lord, from head to foot.
Both. My lord, we will not.
Both. We will haste us.
Both. We will, my lord. Exeunt they two.
Both. We'll wait upon you.
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
Break we our watch up; and by my advice
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
But break my heart, for i must hold my tongue!
But come!
But do not go with it!
But farewell it, for i will use no art.
But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
But if the gods themselves did see her then,
But if't be he i mean, he's very wild
But in battalions! First, her father slain;
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
But let that go.
But let this same be presently perform'd,
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
But now, my cousin hamlet, and my son-
But on! Six barbary horses against six french swords, their
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
But soft! Behold! Lo, where it comes again!
But soft! But soft! Aside! Here comes the king-
But soft! Methinks i scent the morning air.
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
But this eternal blazon must not be
But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
But what is your affair in elsinore?
But wilt thou bear me how i did proceed?
But woe is me! You are so sick of late,
But you shall hear. Thus:
But you'll be secret?
But, as we often see, against some storm,
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
But, in the verity of extolment, i take him to be a soul of great
But, orderly to end where i begun,
By heaven, i'll make a ghost of him that lets me! -
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
By his cockle bat and' staff
By the mass, i was about to say something! Where did i leave?

For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
For me, with sorrow i embrace my fortune.

Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they

Ham. What, ho, horatio!
Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
Ham. What, the fair ophelia?

Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
Hamlet in madness hath polonius slain,
Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
He closes thus: 'i know the gentleman.
He is gone, he is gone,
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
He never gave commandment for their death.
He took my father grossly, full of bread,
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
Help, help, ho!
Her father and myself (lawful espials)
Her mood will needs be pitied.
Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
Here's yet some liquor left.
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
Here, hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
His beard was as white as snow,
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
His liberty is full of threats to all-
His means of death, his obscure funeral-
Hold you the watch to-night?
Hor [aside to hamlet] is't not possible to understand in another
Hor. 'tis here!
Hor. 'twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Hor. 'twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
Hor. (reads the letter) 'horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
Hor. (within) my lord, my lord!
Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Hor. A piece of him.
Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
Hor. As i do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Hor. As thou art to thyself.
Hor. Ay, good my lord.
Hor. Ay, my lord, and of calveskins too.
Hor. Ay, my lord.
Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
Hor. Before my god, i might not this believe
Hor. Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
Hor. Do not, my lord!
Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
Hor. E'en so.
Hor. Friends to this ground.
Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
Hor. Hail to your lordship!
Hor. Half a share.
Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
Hor. Heaven secure him!
Hor. Heaven will direct it.
Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Hor. How was this seal'd?
Hor. I beseech you.
Hor. I did very well note him.
Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
Hor. I warr'nt it will.
Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
Hor. In faith,
Hor. In what particular thought to work i know not;
Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
Hor. Is it a custom?
Hor. Is't possible?
Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
Hor. It might, my lord.
Hor. It must be shortly known to him from england
Hor. It was, as i have seen it in his life,
Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
Hor. Let him bless thee too.
Hor. Let them come in.
Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
Hor. Most constantly.
Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Hor. My lord, i came to see your father's funeral.
Hor. My lord, i did;
Hor. My lord, i think i saw him yesternight.
Hor. My lord, the king your father.
Hor. Nay, good my lord -
Hor. Nay, very pale.
Hor. Never believe it.
Hor. No, by no means!
Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
Hor. Not from his mouth,
Hor. Not i, my lord, by heaven!
Hor. Not when i saw't.
Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
Hor. O, my dear lord!
Hor. O, where, my lord?
Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
Hor. Of that i shall have also cause to speak,
Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.
Hor. Remember it, my lord!
Hor. Season your admiration for a while
Hor. So guildenstern and rosencrantz go to't.
Hor. So have i heard and do in part believe it.
Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
Hor. That can i.
Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
Hor. Very well, my lord.
Hor. Well, my lord.
Hor. Well, sit we down,
Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Hor. What is it you will see?
Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
Hor. What news, my lord?
Hor. What's that, my lord?
Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Hor. Why, what a king is this!
Hor. You might have rhym'd.
Hor. [aside to hamlet] i knew you must be edified by the margent
Hor. [aside to hamlet] no, my good lord.
Hor. [aside] his purse is empty already. All's golden words are
Horatio! - or i do forget myself.
Horatio, friend to hamlet.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
How does my good lord hamlet?
How dost thou, good lord? ' this might be my lord such-a-one, that
How much i had to do to calm his rage i
How now o what hath befall'n?
How now, my lord? Will the king hear this piece of work?
How now, ophelia? What's the matter?
How now, sweet queen?
How now? What news?
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
I am dead, horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
I am more an antique roman than a dane.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
I can no more. The king, the king's to blame.
I cannot live to hear the news from england,
I dare damnation. To this point i stand,
I do beseech you give him leave to go.
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
I had my father's signet in my purse,
I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the french,
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
I must be cruel, only to be kind;
I never gave you aught.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
I pray thee stay with us, go not to wittenberg.
I pray you go with me.
I pray you, now receive them.
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
I shall not look upon his like again.
I stay too long. But here my father comes.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
I'll cross it, though it blast me. - stay illusion!
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. -
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
If by direct or by collateral hand
If circumstances lead me, i will find
If hamlet from himself be taken away,
If hamlet give the first or second hit,
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, i will do
If that his majesty would aught with us,
If there be any good thing to be done,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If you do meet horatio and marcellus,
Imperious caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
In the corrupted currents of this world
In the most high and palmy state of rome,
In thee there is not half an hour of life.
In youth when i did love, did love,
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
Is not this something more than fantasy?
It had been so with us, had we been there.
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
It warms the very sickness in my heart
It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
It will be laid to us, whose providence
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
King. 'tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
King. 'tis hamlet's character. 'naked! '
King. 'tis sweet and commendable in your nature, hamlet,
King. A norman.
King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
King. Alas, alas!
King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
King. Arm you, i pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
King. At supper? Where?
King. Ay, hamlet.
King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
King. Bring him before us.
King. But how hath she
King. But where is he?
King. Come, hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
King. Conceit upon her father.
King. Dead.
King. Do you think 'tis this?
King. Faith, i must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
King. From hamlet? Who brought them?
King. Full thirty times hath phoebus' cart gone round
King. Gertrude, do not drink.
King. Give me some light! Away!
King. Give them the foils, young osric. Cousin hamlet,
King. Go seek him there. [to attendants. ]
King. Good laertes,
King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
King. Have you your father's leave? What says polonius?
King. He made confession of you;
King. How do you, pretty lady?
King. How fares our cousin hamlet?
King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
King. How may we try it further?
King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
King. I do not fear it, i have seen you both;
King. I do not think't.
King. I have nothing with this answer, hamlet. These words are not
King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
King. I pray thee, good horatio, wait upon him.
King. It falls right.
King. It likes us well;
King. It shall be so.
King. Laertes, i must commune with your grief,
King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
King. Let him demand his fill.
King. Let's follow, gertrude.
King. Let's further think of this,
King. Love? His affections do not that way tend;
King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
King. Not that i know.
King. Not that i think you did not love your father;
King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
King. Now, hamlet, where's polonius?
King. O gertrude, come away!
King. O heavy deed!
King. O, for two special reasons,
King. O, he is mad, laertes.
King. O, speak of that! That do i long to hear.
King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
King. Our son shall win.
King. Part them! They are incens'd.
King. Pluck thein asunder.
King. Pretty ophelia!
King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
King. She sounds to see them bleed.
King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
King. So you shall;
King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
King. Sweet gertrude, leave us too;
King. Take thy fair hour, laertes. Time be thine,
King. Thanks, dear my lord.
King. Thanks, rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern.
King. The doors are broke.
King. The very same.
King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
King. Though yet of hamlet our dear brother's death
King. Thy loving father, hamlet.
King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
King. We will try it.
King. Welcome, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern.
King. Well, we shall sift him.
King. What do you call the play?
King. What dost thou mean by this?
King. What is the cause, laertes,
King. What, gertrude? How does hamlet?
King. Where are my switzers? Let them guard the door.
King. Where is polonius?
King. Who shall stay you?
King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
King. Why, now you speak
King. Will you know them then?
King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
King. [aside] it is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
King. [aside] o, 'tis too true!
King. [rises] my words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
Laer. A norman was't?
Laer. A touch, a touch; i do confess't.
Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
Laer. And so have i a noble father lost;
Laer. Ay my lord,
Laer. Come, my lord. They play.
Laer. Come, one for me.
Laer. Do you see this, o god?
Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
Laer. Farewell, ophelia, and remember well
Laer. Farewell. Exit.
Laer. For hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
Laer. Have at you now!
Laer. He is justly serv'd.
Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
Laer. I pray you give me leave.
Laer. I thank you. Keep the door. [exeunt his followers. ]
Laer. I will do't!
Laer. It well appears. But tell me
Laer. Know you the hand?
Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
Laer. Let this be so.
Laer. Most humbly do i take my leave, my lord.
Laer. Must there no more be done?
Laer. My dread lord,
Laer. My lord, i will be rul'd;
Laer. My lord, i'll hit him now.
Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
Laer. My will, not all the world!
Laer. No.
Laer. None but his enemies.
Laer. O, fear me not!
Laer. O, treble woe
Laer. Say you so? Come on. Play.
Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
Laer. The devil take thy soul!
Laer. Think it no more.
Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
Laer. To his good friends thus wide i'll ope my arms
Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor ophelia,
Laer. Upon my life, lamound.
Laer. Well, again!
Laer. What ceremony else?
Laer. What part is that, my lord?
Laer. Where is my father?
Laer. Where is this king? - sirs, staid you all without.
Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, osric.
Laer. You mock me, sir.
Laer. [aside] and yet it is almost against my conscience.
Laertes, son to polonius.
Leaps in the grave.
Leave us.
Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! Sit you down
Let hercules himself do what he may,
Let him go, gertrude. Do not fear our person.
Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
Let not the royal bed of denmark be
Let's do't, i pray; and i this morning know
Look to't, i charge you. Come your ways.
Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at

Lord. The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
Lords, ladies, officers, soldiers, sailors, messengers, attendants.

Mad call i it; for, to define true madness,
Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt.
Mar. 'tis gone and will not answer.
Mar. 'tis gone!
Mar. And liegemen to the dane.
Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
Mar. Holla, bernardo!
Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
Mar. Is it not like the king?
Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Mar. It is offended.
Mar. Let's follow. 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Mar. Look with what courteous action
Mar. Lord hamlet!
Mar. My good lord!
Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
Mar. No, it is struck.
Mar. Nor i, my lord- in faith.
Mar. Nor i, my lord.
Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
Mar. O, wonderful!
Mar. Peace! Break thee off! Look where it comes again!
Mar. Question it, horatio.
Mar. Shall i strike at it with my partisan?
Mar. Something is rotten in the state of denmark.
Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, horatio.
Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Mar. You shall not go, my lord.

Marcellus, officer.
Marcellus?
Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
Mess. Letters, my lord, from hamlet:
Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; i saw them not.
Mess. Save yourself, my lord:
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
Most holy and religious fear it is
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
Most welcome home! Exeunt ambassadors.
Must i remember? Why, she would hang on him
My brother shall know of it; and so i thank you for your good
My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
My father- methinks i see my father.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
My spirits grow dull, and fain i would beguile
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
My tables! Meet it is i set it down
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
My uncle?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
Nay, come, let's go together.
Near elsinore.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
Never to speak of this that you have heard:
No more, sweet hamlet!
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
No, no, he is dead;
No.
None wed the second but who killed the first.
Now follows, that you know, young fortinbras,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
Now, out of this-
O good horatio, what a wounded name
O hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
O heavens! Is't possible a young maid's wits
O heavy burthen!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
O most pernicious woman!
O shame! Where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
O what a rogue and peasant slave am i!
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O, ho!
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
O, say!
O, step between her and her fighting soul
O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
O, this is counter, you false danish dogs!
O, vengeance!
O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I

Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Oph. Do you doubt that?
Oph. Good my lord,

Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;

Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
Sir, in this audience,
So excellent a king, that was to this
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
So full of artless jealousy is guilt
So oft it chances in particular men
So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
So, as a painted tyrant, pyrrhus stood,
So, by my former lecture and advice,
Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
Sound a flourish. [enter trumpets and kettledrums. Danish
Speak of it! Stay, and speak! - stop it, marcellus!
Speak to her, hamlet.

Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
Such was the very armour he had on
Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
Swear by my sword.
Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
Tell him that by his license fortinbras
That cannot be; since i am still possess'd
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
That i am guiltless of your father's death,
That i distrust you. Yet, though i distrust,
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
The bark is ready and the wind at help,
The canker galls the infants of the spring
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it christian burial.
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. [dies. ]
The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
The end
The fair ophelia! - nymph, in thy orisons
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
The head is not more native to the heart,
The king is a thing-
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
The queen carouses to thy fortune, hamlet.
The queen's closet.
The scripture says adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
The story is extant, and written in very choice italian. You
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
The terms of our estate may not endure
The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
The very place puts toys of desperation,
The violence of either grief or joy
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
Then, venom, to thy work. Hurts the king.
There are more things in heaven and earth, horatio,
There is no shuffling; there the action lies
There lives within the very flame of love
There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
There with fantastic garlands did she come
There's such divinity doth hedge a king
There, my lord.
Therefore i have entreated him along,
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
These hands are not more like.
These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
They were given me by claudio; he receiv'd them
This above all- to thine own self be true,
This bodiless creation ecstasy
This gentle and unforc'd accord of hamlet
This heavy-headed revel east and west
This is one lucianus, nephew to the king.
This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
This is the very ecstasy of love,
This man shall set me packing.
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
This must not be. ' and then i prescripts gave her,
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit.

This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
Throws up [another skull].
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Thus was i, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
To pay five ducats, five, i would not farm it;
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
Treachery! Seek it out.
Try what repentance can. What can it not?

We do it wrong, being so majestical,
We heard it all. - my lord, do as you please;
We should profane the service of the dead
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
We'll put the matter to the present push. -
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Welcome, my good friends.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
What does this mean, my lord?
What is between you? Give me up the truth.
What is the matter?
What is the reason that you use me thus?
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What might you think? No, i went round to work
What think you on't?
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
What wouldst thou have, laertes?
What's hecuba to him, or he to hecuba,
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
When in your motion you are hot and dry-
When second husband let me be accurst!
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
Where is your son?
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where should we have our thanks?
Whereon old norway, overcome with joy,
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
Who calls me villain? Breaks my pate across?
Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
Who hath reliev'd you?
Who is't that can inform me?
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
Why, what an ass am i! This is most brave,
Will return'd shall know you are come home.
Witness this army of such mass and charge,
Woo't drink up esill? Eat a crocodile?
Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast? Woo't tear thyself?

You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. - i am glad to see thee
You cannot speak of reason to the dane
You do remember all the circumstance?
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
You laying these slight sullies on my son
You must not put another scandal on him,
You need not tell us what lord hamlet said.
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
You told us of some suit. What is't, laertes?
Young men will do't if they come to't
